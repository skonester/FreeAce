Zinnia! A cross platform 7Z gui frontend built on Tauri V2!

## Changes in `v0.6.2:`

- **Windows:** Win11 sparse context-menu registration now recovers from an already-registered exact package version (`0x80073CFB`) and defers when Explorer still has the prior shell extension loaded (`0x80073D02`). Deferred installs keep classic Extract/Compress verbs until the modern menu finishes; a restored prior payload is no longer treated as a current-version success that would drop those fallbacks.
- **UI:** Creating an archive over an existing file now asks to replace it instead of overwriting silently.
- **Fix:** Cancelled 7-Zip jobs no longer report as Done after rollback. Convert, Test, Browse, Add, and batch extract honor Cancel between steps, and batch extract keeps Cancel available while a volume is running. Settings Reset waits for any in-flight settings write so a stale snapshot cannot come back after the reset. A broken 7-Zip output stream is treated as a failed run instead of a successful child exit.
- **Security:** Updating an existing archive re-checks the selected file after path resolve so a swapped or case-aliased target cannot be staged in that gap.
- **Updater:** A failed notification-permission check no longer aborts a background update. macOS privileged install reports AppleScript failures instead of panicking if compile or the main-thread callback does not complete.
- **PKG:** Updated packages.

## Changes in `v0.6.0:`

### v0.6.0 is a large feature-packed update :) a lot of painstaking work went into integrating Zinnia with the Windows 11 Context-menu :P

- **NEW - Basic mode:** Drop-first home, warmer floral accent, friendlier copy, and Basic/Power, Support, and Settings in the custom titlebar; Power keeps a separate header row and free resizing.
- **NEW - Basic window effects:** Translucent Basic window with macOS vibrancy and Windows Mica/Acrylic (Linux Basic stays opaque); toggle in Settings with live apply and opaque fallback when FX are off or unsupported.
- **NEW - macOS Finder Sync:** **Extract with Zinnia** / **Compress with Zinnia** on Finder’s primary right-click menu (Keka-style), with Zinnia logo as an adaptive template image.
- **NEW - macOS Finder Services:** Extract/Compress services with OS Integration status (Enabled/Off/Unknown) and **Enable…** that writes `pbs` prefs directly when System Settings checkboxes stall.
- **NEW - Windows 11 context menu:** Signed sparse-package **Zinnia** submenu (Extract/Compress) plus top-level **Extract with Zinnia** on archives; classic Explorer verbs remain for Show more options and as fallback when package registration fails.
- **NEW - Auto-close extract window:** Setting to close the extract window immediately or after a countdown on success (default 1.5 seconds).
- **NEW - Recents:** Compact titlebar dropdown in Basic mode; missing paths drop automatically.
- **UI:** Basic locks main window size when active (non-resizable/non-maximizable); titlebar Maximize is disabled in Basic; roomier Settings sheet; `Ctrl`/`⌘` + `,` opens Settings; stacked modal focus traps; Basic progress clears `aria-busy` when finished.
- **UI:** Selective extract picker uses archive-native path separators; folder toggles and Select all respect rendered rows, search visibility, and the 1,000-row budget; browse tree construction is iterative with depth/member limits.
- **UI:** Clearer errors for symlink/reparse inputs.
- **UI:** Timestamp option label matches behavior (created + accessed; modification always stored); Basic glass no longer paints a solid dock behind Compress; extract-only window matches Basic glass/opaque theming.
- **Windows:** NSIS migrates legacy `v0.5.3` context-menu registration to the `v0.6.0` shell layout; versioned side-by-side shell DLL/MSIX payloads prevent loaded DLLs from blocking updates; uninstall retries sparse AppX removal.
- **Windows:** OS Integration reads live default-app ProgId per format; Ready detection accepts Win11 sparse packages when classic verbs were removed; legacy duplicate Open/Extract/Compress stacking under Show more options is removed on upgrade.
- **Windows:** Large Explorer selections use a private UTF-8 list file; handoffs use a private SDDL temp file with nofollow/owner-checked consume; selection batches cap at 1,000 paths with a 4,096-path hard ceiling.
- **Windows:** Extract propagates Mark-of-the-Web via 7-Zip `-snz`; compress fails closed on nested junction/cloud reparse points; staging ACL uses token SID/SDDL verification instead of locale-specific account names.
- **macOS:** Requires macOS 26+ for the bundled 7-Zip 26.02 binary; default-archiver integration uses `NSWorkspace`/`UTType`; signed artifacts enforce an entitlement allowlist.
- **Linux:** Flatpak resolves before the setup wizard, skips the Updates step, and grants `xdg-download`, `/run/media`, `/mnt`, and `/media` per `SECURITY.md`; WebKitGTK-blocked flows use in-app dialogs.
- **Linux:** RPM/DEB/AppImage/Flatpak x64 release set with updater manifests validated before upload.
- **Security:** Password-protected create/update keeps 7-Zip’s bare `-p` switch and pipes secrets on stdin after stdout/stderr drain; rejects multiple `-t` types, non-encrypting formats, line-break secrets, and `-stl` mistaken as a type.
- **Security:** 7-Zip password spawn uses a buffered channel and registers the child before stdin so Cancel works during password setup; validation and backend output redact secrets.
- **Security:** Extract staging uses private snapshots, reparse/symlink gates, member preflight (`7z l -slt`), relative in-tree symlinks allowed where safe, and publish paths that never overwrite existing destinations without recorded identity.
- **Security:** Unix publish stages are `0o700` while in progress; merged directories restore destination parent mode; hard-link/copy rollback retracts targets only with matching publish identity.
- **Security:** Updater publication verifies every artifact/Minisign pair with the embedded public key; 7-Zip provenance is pinned in `7z-checksums.json`.
- **Security:** Archive create/update stores symlinks and hard links (`-snl`/`-snh`) for `.app`/`.framework` round-trips; safe contained and dangling relative links publish normally while absolute and escaping links remain blocked.
- **Fix:** Compound TAR streams browse, test, and extract in one operation; Windows now packages full `7z.exe` plus `7z.dll` for RAR support with NTFS stream suppression and Mark-of-the-Web propagation.
- **Fix:** Basic prep locks OS handoffs and file-remove controls until a job runs; Power/Basic drops serialize on incoming-path apply locks; Add Files/Folder/Remove/Clear honor busy state; selective extract never passes bare folder paths to 7z.
- **Fix:** Cancel/prepare/quota-stop keep the global 7z soft-lock until staging rollback and journal clear finish; failed commits fail-closed on journal parse errors and retract partial publishes before clearing journals.
- **Fix:** Split-archive recovery, in-process promote recovery, and durable commit phases prevent mixed volumes after interruption; cancel during prepare kills spawned 7z before rollback.
- **Fix:** Protected compress sources (shortcuts, Start Menu paths) default to Desktop; relative compress outputs are rejected; Basic no longer double-shows native error dialogs on failure.
- **Fix:** Quick-extract warm idle, tray, and extract-window teardown avoid Dock zombies and racey idle quit; explicit Extract/Compress handoffs clear mismatched sessions instead of appending.
- **Fix:** Settings/modals no longer mark the titlebar `inert`; Support/About/license links open once in the system browser; macOS Services Extract avoids flashing the main window on cold start.
- **Fix:** Setup wizard Skip no longer fails on AppData directory fsync; Basic titlebar brand layout on Windows; modals respect overlay `[hidden]` for keyboard shortcuts.
- **Updater:** Stable releases also publish beta-channel updater manifests so final-beta installs can move to stable; beta manifest sync to `/releases/latest` runs automatically during release signing.
- **Accessibility:** Contrast tokens, focus rings, danger buttons, path ellipsis RTL, and Basic touch targets updated for WCAG-friendly controls; Flatpak hides the Updates section when updates are unavailable.
- **Codebase:** Modular frontend (`archive/`, `basic/`, `ui/`) and Rust (`process/`, `platform/`, `launch/`) splits; archive commit finalization on `spawn_blocking`; OS integration commands kill process trees on timeout.
- **Testing:** Changelog/updater validation in `npm run test:all`; expanded Rust Clippy/format gates; Windows/macOS CI smoke compiles the shell DLL and universal macOS builds.
- **Docs:** Windows context-menu QA checklist; `SECURITY.md` Flatpak and hard-link TOCTOU notes.
- **PKG:** Updated packages.

## Changes in `v0.4.0:`

### IMPORTANT: THIS IS A SECURITY UPDATE. UPDATE NOW!

- **Security:** Updated Tauri V2 updater signer key.
  - I accidentally leaked the (still encrypted) private key via a `package.json` entry on another project. Zinnia sadly shared the same signer key (bad practice; lessons learned). Rookie mistake - I am very sorry, I know how annoying this is. You will have to manually download and install from this release to update the pubkey.
  - Since the private key that was leaked was still encrypted with a password, it is a better state than if it was the full unencrypted privkey.
  - All previous releases and accompanying binaries have been removed from github and my mirror. The tags still remain.
- **UNZIP:** Added the new Unarchive UI feature set to all OS's! If you open an archive via your OS's context menu with Zinnia, the quick unarchive UI will open instead.
- **UNZIP:** Modified the behavior for the custom unarchiver where unarchived items now go into a folder of their own in the parent folder.
- **Licenses:** Cargo licenses are now included.
- **NEW - Basic / Advanced mode:** Added two new views for essential items only (Basic) and more for power users (Advanced).
  - Basic mode's UI is now a totally different UI from advanced with simple options and an easy/friendly UI!
  - Advanced mode's spacing has been compressed for better space efficiency.
- **PKG:** Updated packages.
