## Threat model

FreeAce is a single-user desktop application. It runs the bundled 7-Zip binary as
a sidecar; it does not run a server or accept network input beyond the signed
update check.

### 7z argument boundary

All 7z invocations go through `validate_run_7z_args`
([`src-tauri/src/validation.rs`](src-tauri/src/validation.rs)), the security
boundary between frontend-supplied arguments and the spawned process:

- Only the commands `a`, `u`, `x`, `l`, `t`, `b` are permitted.
- A mandatory `--` separator divides switches from paths; switches are
  allow-listed by prefix.
- Null bytes and over-length arguments are rejected.
- Positional paths and the `-o` output directory may not contain a `..`
  parent-directory segment (defense-in-depth against path traversal, independent
  of frontend validation).
- Destructive `-sdel` operations are rejected. Users delete source files
  explicitly after verifying the archive.

Arguments are passed to the sidecar as an array, never via a shell string, so
command injection is not possible.

### Output transactions and extraction containment

FreeAce does not let 7-Zip write directly into the final output for mutating
operations:

- Create/update writes to a sibling staging basename. Only a successful process
  promotes the complete output family, including split volumes.
- Extraction writes to a sibling staging directory beside the destination
  (never inside the live user folder). Before extraction, FreeAce copies the
  complete input volume family into a private, recovery-tracked snapshot.
  Member listing and extraction both use that same snapshot, so an ordinary
  source-file replacement cannot change what is extracted after preflight.
  FreeAce lists members (`7z l -slt`) and rejects unsafe `Path =`,
  `Symbolic Link =`, and `Hard Link =` fields. Parent-relative symbolic links
  are resolved against their member directory so contained links remain valid.
  Before promotion, FreeAce
  also snapshots sibling names in the stage parent (new names outside the stage
  fail closed), walks the staged tree, rejects absolute or escaping symbolic
  links and Windows reparse points (relative in-tree links used by macOS
  `.app` / `.framework` bundles are allowed), rejects hard links that alias
  inodes outside the stage, rejects unsupported file types, and applies
  entry-count and expanded-size ceilings. Windows existing-destination merges
  use target-local publication for ACL inheritance; Unix published directories
  receive their destination parent's mode.
- Create/update passes `-snl` / `-snh` so symbolic and hard links inside selected
  folders (for example macOS app bundles) are stored as links rather than
  followed. The backend also injects these switches on create/update so they
  cannot be omitted by the webview. Selected compression inputs must still be
  real files or directories, except for relative symlink _members_ under a
  managed convert temp directory. Archive inputs may be filesystem symlinks;
  FreeAce canonicalizes them to a regular-file target before snapshotting.
  Nested Windows junctions / cloud placeholders inside a compress tree are
  rejected (fail closed). ZIP, 7z, and TAR link trees are covered by real
  bundled-sidecar round-trip tests.
- Caller-supplied `-sns` (NTFS alternate streams) and `-sni` (NT security
  descriptors) remain blocked: packing ADS / ACLs is a known hiding and
  privilege footgun. Windows extraction injects `-sns-` to explicitly disable
  archive-supplied streams.
- On extract, FreeAce injects 7-Zip `-snld10` so macOS `.app` / `.framework`
  nested relative symlinks (`Libraries -> Versions/Current/Libraries`) are
  restored. Default 7-Zip (25.01+) rejects those as "Dangerous link via another
  link". Important: level 10 can also materialize some escaping relative
  symlink targets that default level would ignore, so FreeAce's staged-tree
  validation is mandatory before publish. It accepts contained relative links,
  including intentional dangling links, while rejecting absolute and
  OS-resolved escaping symlinks, plus hard links that alias inodes outside the
  stage root. Never raise to `-snld20`. The webview cannot omit or raise
  `-snld*`.
- On Windows extract, FreeAce preserves the source archive's Mark-of-the-Web in
  its private snapshot and injects 7-Zip `-snz` so `Zone.Identifier` propagates
  onto extracted files (SmartScreen / Office Protected View). A zip downloaded
  in Microsoft Edge should still show MOTW on extracted members. Backend-owned
  `-sns-` prevents archive members from replacing that stream. FreeAce does
  **not** strip MOTW.
- Promotion resolves file/directory conflicts without overwriting unrelated
  destination content. A durable move plan and transaction journal allow an
  interrupted merge or split-archive promotion to be rolled back on restart.
- Cancel/close keeps the global operation slot locked until the child has exited
  and staging cleanup has completed.
- Extraction growth is limited by both expansion ratio and current free disk
  space, with capacity reserved for the OS and other applications.

These checks are defense in depth around 7-Zip's own path sanitization. They do
not make untrusted archives harmless: users should still keep FreeAce and its
bundled 7-Zip current and avoid opening extracted executables they do not trust.

### Password handling

FreeAce removes `-pPASSWORD` before spawning 7-Zip and supplies the password to
7-Zip's prompt through a short-lived stdin pipe. Create/update receives a bare
`-p` switch so 7-Zip prompts instead of silently creating an unencrypted
archive; list/test/extract prompt automatically. The pipe is bounded and then
closed so an unexpected prompt cannot leave the sidecar waiting indefinitely.
The password is therefore not present in the spawned process's command line or
ordinary process listings.

Passwords are never written to the activity log, command preview, or persisted
settings (redacted via `sanitizeCommandArgsForPreview` /
`redactSensitiveText`). Passwords containing line breaks are rejected because
the prompt transport is line-oriented.

The password necessarily exists transiently in FreeAce and 7-Zip process memory
and in the OS pipe buffer. A process with sufficient same-user debugging or
memory-inspection access, a crash dump, or a compromised user session may still
recover it. This transport protects against incidental command-line disclosure;
it does not protect secrets from an attacker who can inspect or control the
running user account.

### Vendored 7-Zip binaries

The 7-Zip binaries in `assets/` are committed to the repository and checksummed
in `assets/7z-checksums.json`. Exact official source URLs, downloaded archive
hashes, versions, and extracted members are recorded in
`assets/7z-provenance.json`. Because they are bundled, a 7-Zip CVE fix
requires manually updating the binaries, regenerating checksums, and shipping a
new FreeAce release; there is no OS-level automatic update mechanism.

**Action:** watch the [7-Zip release page](https://www.7-zip.org/history.txt)
and [NVD vendor page](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?form_type=Basic&results_type=overview&query=7-zip&search_type=all)
for new advisories. When a new 7-Zip version addresses a security issue, run
`npm run 7z:update:check` to compare the pinned version with
`https://github.com/ip7z/7zip/releases/latest`, then run `npm run 7z:update`
(or `npm run 7z:update -- --force` after review when refreshing the same
version). Confirm `assets/7z-provenance.json` records the exact official
archive URLs, archive SHA-256 values, extracted member mapping, and license
notice hashes before cutting a FreeAce release. The updater downloads only the
five official source archives, extracts the seven runtime artifacts, rewrites
checksums/provenance/licenses, removes obsolete assets, and regenerates
prepared sidecars. Prefer an independently installed extractor via
`--trusted-7z <path>` or `FREEACE_TRUSTED_7Z` outside this repository's
candidate `assets/` and generated `src-tauri/binaries/` roots; when none is
available the updater may use the currently checksum-verified bundled sidecar
only to unpack official Windows self-extracting `.exe` packages. Official
`.tar.xz` sources use the system `tar`. For a fully offline reviewed refresh,
`node scripts/prepare-7z.js --update-checksums --all --version <verified-version> --verify-downloads <download-directory> --trusted-7z <independently-trusted-7z-path>`
still refuses to run when the explicit version, downloaded archives, or
extracted members do not match the reviewed provenance manifest.

#### Windows RAR support

Windows packages full `7z.exe` with its architecture-matched `7z.dll`, enabling
RAR browse, test, conversion, and extraction. The binaries and DLLs are pinned
to official installers in `assets/7z-provenance.json` and verified before
packaging. Extraction forces `-sns-` to reject archive-supplied NTFS alternate
streams, while the private input snapshot preserves the source archive's
`Zone.Identifier` for backend-owned `-snz` propagation. This prevents a RAR5
stream-name collision from replacing Mark-of-the-Web data.

### Translucent Basic window (macOS / Windows)

Basic mode may enable OS-native window glass (`macOSPrivateApi` +
`window-vibrancy`). This is cosmetic only: Power mode and Linux stay opaque,
and effects-off paints a solid background via `set_background_color`. The
webview still runs under the same CSP and command allow-lists; translucency
does not expand filesystem or network reach.

### Flatpak filesystem access

The Flatpak package grants `--filesystem=home`, `--filesystem=xdg-download`,
`--filesystem=/run/media`, `--filesystem=/media`, and `--filesystem=/mnt` because the bundled 7-Zip
sidecar must read/write user-selected archive paths, including common USB and
download locations outside `$HOME`. Document portals alone cannot cover sidecar
I/O today. This expands the sandbox blast radius relative to a portal-only app;
treat untrusted archives with the same caution as on other platforms.

There is intentionally no `--share=network`. Flatpak builds do not use the
in-app GitHub updater (Settings update UI is hidden); refresh via Flathub or a
reinstalled sideload bundle instead.

### Upstream Rust advisory review

`src-tauri/.cargo/audit.toml` contains a deliberately narrow, documented list
of transitive Tauri/wry/GTK3 advisories. CI fails for every advisory outside
that list. Before each stable release, review the ignored list against the
resolved dependency tree and remove an ignore as soon as Tauri provides an
upgrade path. In particular, the GTK `glib` `VariantStrIter` soundness advisory
is not reached by FreeAce's code, but it remains a Linux runtime dependency and
must not be treated as resolved merely because `cargo audit` allows it.

### Same-user filesystem race boundary

FreeAce re-checks extraction ancestors immediately before publishing staged
output. A same-user process can still race the final rename or hard_link after
that check. Fully eliminating that residual race requires platform-specific
no-follow directory handles; it is tracked as architectural security debt.
The current staging, canonical-path, symlink/reparse, and post-extraction
validation checks remain mandatory defense in depth.

On Unix, promote opens use `O_NOFOLLOW` for the final path component. On
Windows, `open_regular_file_nofollow` opens with `FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`
and rejects reparse tags on the opened handle. Archive publish syncs the
source through that nofollow handle, then uses exclusive path `rename` /
`hard_link` (same residual TOCTOU as above). When neither is available, the
fallback exclusive-create copy re-opens the source with nofollow and copies
from that held handle. Residual same-user TOCTOU remains for the rename /
hard_link path-name lookup itself.

### Open-folder allowlist

The main window may only `open_path` directories that a recent successful
compress/extract promoted. Extract-only windows bind their destination folder at
window spawn (derived from the archive path). They may only extract to that
folder (`-o`) and may only `open_path` that same folder after registering it.
This is defense in depth against a compromised webview writing or opening
arbitrary folders.

The main window `run_7z` destination (`-o`) is not dest-bound the way extract
windows are. After path validation (no `..` segments, absolute paths only),
extract-to-folder uses the same privilege as the signed app. A compromised main
webview can therefore write to any allowlisted-shape destination the user could
already reach. Extract-only windows remain pinned to the folder derived at
window spawn.
