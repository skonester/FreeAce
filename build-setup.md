# Build prerequisites for FreeAce

## Windows

- Windows 10/11 x64 or ARM64
- PowerShell 7.x
- Developer PowerShell / Command Prompt for VS 2022 or VS 2026 (C++ workload)
- **CMake 3.20+** (bundled with the VS C++ workload, or standalone; **4.2+** when building
  against Visual Studio 18 / 2026). Builds locate CMake via `vswhere` when it is not on PATH.
- After upgrading to **Visual Studio 2026**, re-check Visual Studio Installer → **Modify** →
  **Desktop development with C++** includes **C++ CMake tools for Windows** (updates can drop
  optional components; an old VS 2022 `cmake` on PATH stops working when 2022 is removed).
- **Windows SDK** (`makeappx.exe`) for Win11 sparse context-menu packages
- Node.js `^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26` (`engines.node` in package.json)
- Rust (rustup) + Visual Studio Build Tools (clang: x64 and arm64)

## macOS

- macOS 26 or later
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Node.js `^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26` (`engines.node` in package.json)
- Rust (rustup)

## Linux

- Build public AppImage and DEB artifacts on Ubuntu 24.04. It is the oldest
  supported glibc baseline, so an AppImage built there remains compatible with
  the documented Ubuntu 24.04+ support floor. Do not build AppImages on Debian
  13, Fedora 43, or an unpinned newer host.
- Build and test RPM artifacts on Fedora 43. Test the DEB/AppImage on Debian
  13 and the RPM on Fedora 43; these distributions are runtime targets, not
  interchangeable AppImage build baselines.
- Node.js `^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26` (`engines.node` in package.json)
- Rust (rustup)
- Build essentials (gcc, g++, make)
- zlib development headers (`zlib1g-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `zlib-devel` on
  Fedora) to build the bundled `freeace` (Gleipnir) sidecar
- AppImage, rpm, deb tooling if building those bundles
- Flatpak + flatpak-builder if building Flatpak

## Rust toolchain policy

FreeAce always builds with the newest Rust `stable` available at build time. Do
not pin a Rust release. Install or refresh it before building:

```sh
npm run rust:update
```

## License notice audit

`npm run licenses:cargo` writes both the packaged Cargo license data and an
exact unresolved-package report. Every prerelease and stable release runs
`npm run release:licenses`, which uses `licenses:cargo:strict` and fails until
every dependency has a verified license notice. For crates that omit a
workspace-root notice from the published package, strict mode may fetch the
exact HTTPS repository and immutable commit recorded in `.cargo_vcs_info.json`,
then recover the nearest upstream license text. If the exact source revision
also contains no license text, a package-version-scoped source-omission review
records that fact and keeps the declared SPDX references visible. Do not
replace missing notices with generic SPDX templates or moving-branch content.

## Updating bundled 7-Zip

Check the official GitHub release tag and update status:

```sh
npm run 7z:update:check
```

Download the latest official Linux, macOS, and Windows archives, extract only
the runtime binaries and notices, verify their hashes, remove obsolete assets,
and regenerate prepared sidecars:

```sh
npm run 7z:update
```

The updater requires an external trusted extractor. Pass `--trusted-7z <path>`
or set `FREEACE_TRUSTED_7Z`. The in-tree 7-Zip sidecar is not trusted for this
update. Use `--force` to refresh assets when the official version has not
changed.

## Verify the toolchain

```sh
npm ci
npm run prepare:7z
npm run test:all
npx tauri build --no-bundle
```

CI runs tests and checks only. It must never invoke `release:*` scripts or build
release binaries; signed bundles are produced on isolated platform build VMs.

Before a stable release, run the packaged-artifact QA matrix in
[`docs/QA-CONTEXT-MENUS.md`](docs/QA-CONTEXT-MENUS.md) on those platform build
VMs. CI compile smoke does not prove operating-system shell registration,
notarization, updater behavior, or desktop-environment MIME integration.

## Release artifact freshness

The normal `npm run release:win`, `release:mac`, and `release:linux` entry points
prepare locked dependencies, run the release-VM gate with GUI E2E skipped,
remove old bundles, and create a commit- and environment-bound build session.
The exact release commit must already have passed the complete `test:all` gate
with E2E enabled in protected CI or in a clean proving checkout. Release builds
reuse the generated versions, licenses, and sidecars instead of preparing them
again.

If `npm run release:prepare` was run separately and completed successfully, use
the matching `release:win:resume`, `release:mac:resume`, or
`release:linux:x64:resume` command. `release:linux` is the x64 release alias;
run `release:linux:arm64` only on native ARM64 hardware or an explicitly
configured emulator. Resume still runs branch/upstream preflight
and refuses sessions from a different commit, version, lockfile, platform,
architecture, Node/Rust toolchain, or sessions older than 24 hours. Do not run
`release:prepare` manually and then use the non-resume entry point, because the
normal entry point intentionally prepares and tests again.

For a beta recovery where one platform already built the same version before
the release branch advanced, pass `--skip-check` to bypass only the draft's
exact target-commit check during draft reuse and signing. Example:
`npm run release:mac -- --skip-check` or
`npm run release:linux -- --skip-e2e --skip-check`. This uses the existing
`FORCE_UPLOAD` recovery path for the continuation only; all preflight, tests,
release-session, version, signing, and artifact checks still run. Stable
releases reject this recovery override. The SSH-keychain entry point accepts
the same flags: `npm run release:mac:ssh -- --skip-e2e --skip-check`.

The GPG staging script also verifies the session and rejects artifacts older
than its marker, including versionless canonical installer names, so a stale
bundle cannot be signed accidentally.

Flatpak packaging additionally exports the exact clean `HEAD` tree into an
ignored staging directory. It refuses tracked working-tree changes; commit the
intended release state before running `npm run flatpak:bundle`. npm and Cargo
downloads remain integrity-locked for this sideload-only build.

Updater manifests are generated only after each Tauri Minisign signature has
been cryptographically matched to its artifact with the public key in
`tauri.conf.json`. The generated manifests are schema-validated before upload.

The `b`, `r`, and `release:*` scripts intentionally reset and clean their Git
worktrees. Run them only on disposable, isolated build VMs. Before publishing,
verify that the draft contains the expected Windows x64/ARM64 NSIS installers,
universal macOS DMG/ZIP, Linux x64 AppImage/DEB/RPM/Flatpak, updater
manifests/signatures, SHA-256 lists, and GPG detached signatures. Include Linux
ARM64 AppImage/DEB/RPM only when intentionally running `release:linux:arm64`;
the normal public release currently ships Linux x64 only. Flatpak remains
x64-only (`flatpak:bundle` / `release:linux:x64`); `release:linux:arm64` does
not build a Flatpak.

AppImage desktop entries reuse the Debian data layout, including
`bundle.linux.deb.desktopTemplate` (`linux/desktop-template.hbs`). Keep that
template (and compound TAR MIME associations) correct for AppImage as well as
DEB/RPM.

CI `tauri build --no-bundle` is compile smoke only. Before publishing, run the
Linux package matrix in `docs/QA-CONTEXT-MENUS.md` on build VMs (AppImage/DEB/
RPM/Flatpak launchers, MIME handlers, and desktop actions).

The Tauri plugins are already declared in `package.json` and
`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`; do not re-add them during normal setup.
