 *
 * Historical note: this file began as gen14.c and the internals still use the
 * `gen` prefix throughout, including the GENA magic number in the archive
 * header.  The container format is unchanged by the rename -- archives written
 * before it still read correctly, and the magic stays GENA so that remains
 * true.  Only the program's name changed.
 *
 * Originally: cache-blocked context-mixing compressor.
 *
 * gen8 was correct but memory-bound: predict() computed a fresh scattered
 * index per model per bit, so a single byte cost ~144 random DRAM accesses.
 * gen14 keeps the same modelling ideas and changes the data layout:
 *
 *   - nibble groups.  Each model's table is an array of 64-byte groups (one
 *     cache line).  A group holds the 15 counters for every partial-bit state
 *     inside one nibble.  We hash once per nibble, touch one line, and serve
 *     four bits from L1.  144 misses/byte -> 18.
 *   - all group addresses for a nibble are computed and prefetched up front,
 *     so the remaining misses overlap instead of serialising.
 *   - a check field per group detects hash collisions, so aliased contexts are
 *     reset rather than silently averaged together.  Costs nothing, helps ratio.
 *   - the mixer runs over a padded 16-float row so -march=native vectorises it.
 *   - counters are 16-bit with integer adaptive rates (no float conversion).
 *
 * Modelling gains over gen8:
 *   - the match model's confidence is *learned* (an adaptive table indexed by
 *     match length and predicted bit) instead of a hand-tuned constant.
 *   - two chained APM/SSE stages instead of one.
 *   - 512 mixer weight sets (partial byte x match state) instead of 256.
 *

 *
 * The stride used to be found by voting: each 2-byte context remembered where

 * where the record is 28, because every *multiple* of a period recurs just as
 * reliably as the period; it missed the 1024-byte rows of mr entirely; and on

 * change resetting the column phase and discarding the statistics.
 *
 * What the record contexts actually ask is "is the byte one stride back a good
 * predictor of this one".  Mean absolute difference answers exactly that, so
 * the stride is now measured directly, once, on the encoder, and carried in
 * the header.  That makes it exact rather than adaptive, removes a 256 KB

 * When the match model has held for BYT bytes running, the full model is
 * being paid to confirm what the match already knows: the bit costs ~0.01
 * bits to code and ~27 group probes, 30 StateMap loads, the ISSE chain, the
 * mixer and up to six serial APMs to predict.  Inside such a run each byte is
 * coded through the match StateMap alone -- still adaptive, one L1 load per
 * bit -- and the byte is then absorbed exactly like a stored byte, so the
 * match model, record phase and word state stay coherent.  paq9a and zpaq's
 * mid methods are the precedent.
 *
 * The gate reads only mlen and mptr, which encoder and decoder maintain
 * identically, so the decision is always symmetric.  Context tables are not
 * updated during a bypassed byte (that is the ratio cost, swept with BYT);
 * group pointers are refreshed lazily on the next modelled byte.
 *
 * If the predicted bit misses mid-byte the match dies, and the rest of the
 * byte is coded through bsm -- a 256-entry StateMap over the partial byte,
 * trained only on bypassed bits, so it is warm for exactly this situation. */

 *
 * Reversibility needs two things.  First, a predicate the transform cannot
 * disturb: we test the opcode d[i] and the operand's high byte d[i+4], and
 * rewrite only the low 24 bits in between, so a position's eligibility reads
 * the same before and after.  (Testing the value itself does not work -- the
 * encoder would be asking about rel while the decoder asks about abs, and at
 * the 16 MB boundary those disagree.)
 *
 * Second, matching scan order.  An operand at j overlaps the windows of the
 * positions just below it, so the two passes must observe those bytes in the
 * same state.  Encoding backwards and decoding forwards achieves exactly
 * that: at position i, both passes see every transform above i applied and
 * every one below i not applied.  Neither pass skips, so both visit the same
 * positions, and decoding forwards inverts the backward composition in the

/* ===================================================================
 * Archive layer
 * ===================================================================
 *
 * Everything above this line is the model and is unchanged: it turns a buffer
 * into a compressed blob and back.  Everything below turns that into something
 * you can point at a directory and still trust in five years.
 *
 * The v1 container was a benchmark harness.  It opened with a bare type byte,
 * then read lengths straight out of the file and passed them to malloc.  It
 * had no magic number, no version, no checksum of any kind, no bound on any
 * field it parsed, no way to verify an archive without fully restoring it, and
 * it sized the input with a 32-bit ftell so anything past 2 GB was silently
 * wrong.  For measuring compression ratio all of that is irrelevant.  For data
 * you intend to keep, each one is a separate way to lose the archive without
 * being told.
 *
 * v2 layout:
 *
 *   [header 48B]        magic, version, preset, member count, index offset,
 *                       and an XXH64 over the preceding 40 bytes
 *   [segment payloads]  written in order, streamed, never all resident
 *   [index]             members (name, size, mtime, mode, SHA-256, segment
 *                       range) then segments (offset, lengths, XXH64)
 *   [trailer 20B]       index XXH64, index length, magic
 *
 * The index sits at the end so writing never seeks backwards, which is what
 * lets the whole thing stream.  Its position is recorded twice -- once in the
 * header, once implicitly by the trailer -- so a header damaged in storage
 * does not on its own cost you the archive.
 *
 * A segment is the unit of independent compression, integrity, parallelism and
 * damage containment, all at once.  Corruption inside a segment loses that
 * segment; every other segment still decodes, and 't' reports exactly which
 * ones are gone rather than failing the whole file.
